# Fundamental Types of Graphs Models

## Types of Graphs Models

- Undirected Graphs
- Directed Graphs
- Weighted Graphs (edge-weighted)
    - Weighted Undirected Graphs
    - Weighted Directed Graphs
- Cyclic and Acyclic Graphs
- Minimum Spanning Trees

## Structures of Graphs

- Simple Graph
    - Only node pairs with one relationship
- Multi-graph
    - Multiple node pairs relationship
- Pseudo-graph
    - Multiple node pairs relationship with loop back on nodes

## Connected and Disconnected Graphs

## Summary Table of Types, Structure and Models (Classes) of Graphs

| Class                     | Key Factor                                                | Algorithm Consideration |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Connected vs Disconnected | is or isn't Path between any two nodes                    |                         |
| Weighted vs Unweighted    | is or isn't Value between any two nodes                   |                         |
| Directed vs Undirected    | relationships defines/doesn't define a start and end node |                         |
| Cyclic vs Acyclic         | is or isn't a cycle in a path                             |                         |
| Sparse vs Dense           |                                                           |                         |
