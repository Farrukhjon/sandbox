***Recurrence Relation is***

- is an **equation**

  - *recursively* defined

    - a **sequence** of *multidimensional* array of values

  - with **base** (*initial*) ***term*** (value)

  - and **recursive** *part - **function** of preceding <u>terms</u>*

**Examples** of Recurrence Relations:

- **Fibonacci** equation

- **Binomial coefficient**

- **Logistic map**

Classification of Recurrence relation:

1.  Homogeneous or non-homogeneous

2.  Linear or Nonlinear

3.  Order of the Recurrence Relation

4.  Constant versus non-constant coefficients

Methods of solution/Finding closed form expression:

1.  solving linear recurrence relations

2.  generating functions

3.  substitution method

4.  method of summation factors
