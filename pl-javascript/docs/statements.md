# Statements and declarations

## Control flow

### return

### break

### continue

### throw

### if..else

### switch

### try...catch

## Declaring variables

### var

- Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

### let

- Declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

### const

- Declares a read-only named constant.

## Functions and classes

### function

- Declares a function with the specified parameters.

### function*

- Generator Functions enable writing iterators more easily.

### async function

- Declares an async function with the specified parameters.

### async function*

- Asynchronous Generator Functions enable writing async iterators more easily.

### class

- Declares a class.

## Loops and Iterations

### do...while

- Creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to false. The condition is
  evaluated after executing the statement, resulting in the specified statement executing at least once.

### for

- Creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons,
  followed by a statement executed in the loop.

### for...in

- Iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, in arbitrary order. For each distinct property, statements can
  be executed.

### for...of

- Iterates over iterable objects (including arrays, array-like objects, iterators and generators), invoking a custom
  iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property.

### for await...of

Iterates over async iterable objects, array-like objects, iterators and generators, invoking a custom iteration hook
with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property.

### while

- Creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is
  evaluated before executing the statement.
