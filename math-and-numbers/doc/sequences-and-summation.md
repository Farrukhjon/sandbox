Topics

- Sequences

- Terms (Elements/Items/Members)

- Series

- Summation

Ways to Define a Sequence

- Pattern based: Set

- General definition/n-th terms: Function-based

- Recursively defined (see: Recurrence relation)

Types of Sequences (progression)

- Arithmetic progression

  - common difference

    - between terms

- Geometric progression

  - common ratio

    - between terms

- Fibonacci sequence

**Summation** of the **Terms** (elements) of a **Sequence**
