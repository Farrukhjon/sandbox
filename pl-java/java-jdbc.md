---

**Q: How many ways getting a connection JDBC supports?**

**A:**
There are two ways to get a connection

- By using class java.sql.`DriverManager`
- By creating object of interface java.sql.`DataSource`

**Q: Why do we use a DataSource instead of a DriverManager?**

**A:**
DataSource

- Provides creating a Connection Pool
- Provides caching
- Provides JNDI for scalable and maintainable connection properties
- Can be maintained by an Application Server

**Q: What is the difference between `Statement`, `PreparedStatement` and `CallableStatement`?**

**A:** All provide executing query to a database

- Statement
    - allows executing general purpose query
    - send sql query directly for each execution (not pre-compiled by DBMS)
- PreparedStatement
    - allows executing `parametric` and `dynamic` queries
    - used pre-compiled query in the database, so that allows executing second and others query more faster, because
      DBMS allows caching
    - prevents `SQL injection` attacks in Java by validating number of passed parameters to a query string
    - `index` of a placeholder starts from `1` not from `0`
- CallableStatement
    - used for executing stored procedures queries

**Q: How do you prevent SQL Injection in Java Code?**

By using PreparedStatement Java provides avoidance SQL-Injection attack.
