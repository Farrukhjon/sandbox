## Incidence Edges

        If a node is an endpoint of an edge, then the node is said to be incident on the edge, and the edge is incident on teh node.
        The nodes incident to an edge are called its endpoints.

## Adjacency

    Adjacent edges are two edges that have an endpoint in common.
    A Node (Node1) is adjacent to Node (node2) if they are joined by an edge

## Neighborhood

    Two adjacent nodes may be called neighbors.
