## Quality Attributes of Software

### Functionality

    The capability of the software product to provide functions, which meet stated conditions and implied needs when the
    software is used under specified conditions.

### Correctness

    Extent to which a program satisfies its specifications and fulfills the user’s mission objectives.

### Reliability

    The capability of the software product to maintain a specified level of performance when used under specified
    conditions.

### Efficiency

    The capability of the software product to provide appropriate performance, relative to the amount of resources used,
    under stated conditions.

### Usability

    The capability of the software product to be understood, learned, used and attractive to the user, when used under
    specified conditions.

### Maintainability

    The capability of the software product to be modified. Modifications may include corrections, improvements or adaptation
    of the software to changes in environment, and in requirements and functional specifications.

### Performance

    The system’s ability to meet timing requirements, within given constraints such as speed, accuracy, memory usage etc.

### Fault tolerance

    The property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of (or one or more faults
    within) some of its components.

### Flexibility

    Effort required modifying an operational program.

### Testability

    Effort required to test a program to ensure it performs its intended function.

### Reusability

    Extent to which a program can be used in other applications-related to the packaging and scope of the functions that
    programs perform.

### Portability

    The capability of the software product to be transferred from one environment to another.
    Interoperability
    Effort required coupling one system with another.

### Safety

### Supportability

### Trade-Offs of Quality Attributes
