| Shortest Path               | Finds the shortest path or paths between two chosen nodes                                             |
| Single Source Shortest Path | Finds from a chosen node to all others                                                                |
| All Pairs Shortest Path     | Finds the shortest paths between all pairs                                                            |
| Minimum Spanning Tree       | Finds a connected tree structure with the smallest cost for visiting all nodes from a chosen node     |
| Random Walk                 | Returns a list of nodes along a path of specified size by randomly choosing relationships to traverse |
