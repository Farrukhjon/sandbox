## Incidence Edges

If there are `two nodes connected by an edge`, so it's called:

- the edge is `incident` to the `both nodes`
- the nodes are `adjacent` to each others

       If a node is an endpoint of an edge, then the node is said to be incident on the edge, and the edge is incident on teh node.
       The nodes incident to an edge are called its endpoints.
- `nodes incident to an edge` are called its `endpoints`

## Adjacency

    Adjacent edges are two edges that have an endpoint in common.
    A Node (Node1) is adjacent to Node (node2) if they are joined by an edge

- Adjacent nodes - nodes which have an incident edge in common

## Neighborhood

    Two adjacent nodes may be called neighbors.
