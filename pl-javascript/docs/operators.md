# Operators

## The =, ==, and === Operators

    JavaScript supports =, ==, and === operators.
    Be sure you understand the differences between these assignment, equality,
    and strict equality operators, and be careful to use the correct one when coding!
    
    Although it is tempting to read all three operators as “equals,” it may help to reduce confusion if you read
      “gets” or “is assigned” for =
      “is equal to” for ==
      “is strictly equal to” for ===
    
    The == operator is a legacy feature of JavaScript and is widely considered to be a source of bugs. You should almost
    always use === instead of ==, and !== instead of !=.
