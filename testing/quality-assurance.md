## Quality Assurance (QA)

### Overview of QA

- Quality
- Testing

### Test Case Management (TCM)

- What is TCM
- Writing Test Cases
- Processes of TCM
- Tools of TCm

### Defect Management (DM)

- What is DM
- Process of DM
- Verification and Closure
- Reporting and Metrics of Defect

### Testing Non-Functional Requirements

- The Value of Non-Functional Testing
- Functional vs Non-Functional Testing
- Types of Non-Functional Testing
- Non-Functional Testing in SDLC

### QA Metrics

- Types of QA Metrics
- QA Metrics Life Cycle

### Automated Testing (AutoTest)

- Benefits and Costs of AutoTest
- Attributes of Auto Testing
- Test Data Management
- Metrics of Auto Testing
- Reports and Results of Auto Testing

### Attributes of Quality

- Functionality
- Availability
- Performance
- Testability
- Security
- Usability
- Reliability

### Best Practices for QA

- Create a single documented test process that all teams follow.
- Participate in key project meetings (planning, design/impact analysis discussions, backlog refinement, stand-up, demo,
- retrospective, and so on).
- Consider test estimates during iteration and release planning.
- Establish and update your test plan and test strategy documents.
- Create a test report during each release.
- Test non-functional requirements (e.g., stress testing, load testing, usability testing, security testing).

### Test Case Management (TCM)

#### Test Plan

- is a detailed document
- outlining the scope of testing, required resources
- a complete timeline of testing activities.
- can include multiple test suites and test cases.

#### Test Suites

- Functionality 1 Test Suite
    - Test Case A
    - Test Case B
    - Test Case C
- Functionality 2 Test Suite
    - Test Case D
    - Test Case E
- Functionality 3 Test Suite
    - Test Case F

#### Test Suite

- is a collection of several test cases
- used to verify specific functionality.
- multiple test suites may share a test case
- the purpose of each test suite is different.
- may pertain to specific types of testing, such as:
    - sanity testing: determines if modifications to code have fixed issues without introducing new ones
    - smoke testing: verifies if basic functionalities work or not
    - regression testing: ensures that changes havenâ€™t broken existing functionality
    - UI testing: replicates how a user interacts with an application and checks all the system layers
    - performance testing: determines how a system performs under a particular workload
    - API testing: checks the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of APIs

#### Test Case

- comprises the steps used to verify that a specific piece of functionality
- if that works correctly
- if that meets the project requirements
- can be organized into one or more test suites

#### Life Cycle of a Test Case

- Analysis of the Requirements
- Environment set up for a test case, if required
- Tools to choose for a test case
- Write a test case
- Map each requirement to the test case (to cover all)
- Share the test case for Review
- Execute the test case
- Perform Regression test (if necessary)
- Inspect Automated and mManual test cases, they are unique (not duplicated)
