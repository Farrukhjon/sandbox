# Akka patterns

 - The **Master Slave work pulling** pattern
   - issue:
     - mailbox message overflow
       - each actor is able to process one message at a time
       - and the rest of the messages get enqueued into the mailbox
       - unbounded mailbox - OOM (out-of-memory issue)
       - bounded mailbox - dropping message
       - solution:
         - delegating tasks/messages to worker actors (children/remote actors)
         - the actors run either in a separate JVMs or remote machines  
 - **Ordered termination of actors**
 - **Shutdown** patterns in Akka
 - **Scheduling periodic messages** to an actor
 - **Throttling of messages while sending** them to an actor
 - **Balancing workload** across actors
 - The **Aggregator** pattern
 - The **CountDownLatch** pattern
 - **Finite-State Machine**
 - The **Pausable** actor pattern
 - **Enveloping** actor
