# Generic Types

## Definition of Generic Types (Generic Class or Generic Interface)

    A class or interface whose declaration has one or more Type Parameters is a Generic Class Or Interface.
    So, Generic Classes and Interfaces are collectively known as Generic Types.
    Each Generic Type defines a set of Parameterized Types,
    which consist of the class or interface name followed by an Angle-Bracketed List Of actual Type Parameters
    corresponding to the generic typeâ€™s formal type parameters.
